# AppointmentPlatform


This is a medical appointment platform project implemented by **Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**. The database has not been used yet and will be in the future version.

Currently, **DoublyLinkedList** and **HashMap** are used to better perform inserting and deleting.





:star2: This project mainly focuses on 3 essential features:

(1) Make an appointment for a new patient and add them to the waiting list.

(2) Cancel the appointment on the waiting list.

(3) Priority the patients with a high level of emergency.
